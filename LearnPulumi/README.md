**Phase 3: Writing Infrastructure Code with Go (Estimated: 3-4 Days)**
* **Goal:** Learn how to define and manage infrastructure resources using the Pulumi Go SDK.
* **Topics:**
    * **Pulumi Go SDK Structure:** Understanding packages and how to import provider SDKs (e.g., `github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/sdk/v6/go/aws`).
    * **Resource Definition:** Creating instances of resource types (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets).
    * **Resource Properties:** Configuring resource attributes using Go code.
    * **Outputs:** Understanding asynchronous values and how to work with them.
    * **Configuration in Go:** Accessing and using Pulumi configuration within your Go code.
    * **Basic Resource Dependencies:** Implicit and explicit dependencies between resources.
* **Resources:**
    * Official Pulumi Documentation - Go: [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/languages-sdks/go/](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/languages-sdks/go/)
    * Pulumi Examples (filter by Go): [https://github.com/pulumi/examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples)
    * Provider-specific documentation (e.g., AWS provider: [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/aws/](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/aws/)).
* **Action Items:**
    * Deploy a simple infrastructure component (e.g., an S3 bucket) using Go.
    * Modify the code to add more properties to the resource.
    * Deploy a second resource and observe the Pulumi plan.

**Tips for Success:**
* **Hands-on Practice is Key:** The more you code and deploy infrastructure with Pulumi and Go, the better you'll understand it.
* **Start Small and Iterate:** Don't try to build everything at once. Begin with simple resources and gradually add complexity.
* **Refer to the Documentation:** The official Pulumi and Go documentation are your best resources.
* **Engage with the Community:** Join the Pulumi Slack community or forums to ask questions and learn from others.
* **Explore Provider SDKs:** Familiarize yourself with the SDKs for the cloud providers you use most frequently.
* **Think Like a DevOps Engineer:** Apply your existing knowledge of infrastructure, automation, and best practices to your Pulumi projects.
