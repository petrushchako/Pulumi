# Getting Started With Pulumi
Managing cloud infrastructure can often be a challenge of wrangling obtuse configuration files or manually configuring resources through your cloud provider’s web console. In this course, Getting Started with Pulumi, you’ll learn the basics of managing cloud infrastructure using your favorite programming language. First, you’ll explore creating, modifying, and destroying cloud resources in providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Next, you’ll discover how to create dependencies between resources – servers, databases, storage, DNS, and more – so that they are dynamically configured to work together. Finally, you’ll learn how to make reusable groups of resources so that you can create and destroy independent replicas of your environments for testing or demos. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll be ready to start using Pulumi to manage your cloud infrastructure.
